      <p>Automod was created by Anirudh Tenneti with the intent of making the social deduction game Mafia (the version played by <a href="https://mafiaclub.github.io">Cornell Mafia Club</a>) playable by everyone without needing an extra person to moderate. Better yet, as a computer program, Automod is not prone to human error*. The days of mod fails are gone.</p>
      <h3>Setup</h3>
      <p>Players enter their names in the text box. To minimize hassle, players should sit in a circle with names entered in clockwise seat order (i.e. the person on your right, then you, then the person on your left, and so on). Once this is done, each player, without showing the device to others, will receive a role and a number. Claiming a role is OK, but discussion of player numbers is forbidden to avoid metagaming. Don't forget the number, as you will be woken up based on it!</p>
      <h3>Night</h3>
      <p>At night, the device will move around the circle clockwise. When you receive it, look only at the device and not at other players. If it displays your number, you "wake up" for your action and may look at other players. If the number is not yours, pass it to your left. The only exception is for players that wake up together (e.g. the Mafia), in which case you pass the device on but keep your eyes open until the device stops moving, at which point your whole team is awake. When passing, you may want to tap the recipient to let them know the device is coming their way to ensure that they don't drop it. Once it is handed off, close your eyes. The device will most likely make multiple passes around the circle. Most information roles will choose a target on one pass and receive information on the next pass.</p>
      <h3>Day</h3>
      <p>When all night actions are done, a random person will be told to wake everyone up. At this point, daytime can be led by any player, preferably a dead player since living players would be discussing the game. The day can be run however you want, as long as the town has a chance to either vote 1 person out or abstain. Then, everyone goes to sleep, the device is handed to any living player, and the game continues until any side wins.</p>
      <p>*Unless I made a mistake in coding. With so many roles, it's possible. If something seems off, send a bug report using the contact link on the club's <a href="https://mafiaclub.github.io">homepage</a> and describe what led to the error.</p>
      <h3>Supported roles</h3>
      <p>Not all roles can be supported because some pose difficulties for a webpage to moderate, for example, those that affect voting or rely on seat positions. Visit the <a href="https://mafiaclub.github.io">club website</a> to see these roles' abilities.</p>
